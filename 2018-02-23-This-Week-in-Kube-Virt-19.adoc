This is a bi-weekly update from the KubeVirt team.

We are currently driven by

- Building a solid user-story around KubeVirt
- Caring about end-to-end (backend, core, ui)
- Getting dependencies into shape (storage)
- Improve the user-experience for users (UI, deployment)
- Being easier to be used on Kubernetes and OpenShift

Within the last two weeks we achieved to:

- Support for native file-system PVs as disk storage (@alukiano, @davidvossel)
  (https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/734,
   https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/671)
- Support for native pod networking for VMs (@vladikr)
  (https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/686)

- Add vendor/ tree (@davidvossel)
  (https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/715)
- Expose disk bus (@fromani)
  (https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/672)
- Allow deploying OpenShift in vagrant (@alukiano)
  (https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/631)

- Release of v0.3.0-alpha.3
  (https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/tag/v0.3.0-alpha.3)

In addition to this, we are also working on:

- Implement VirtualMachinePresets (@stu-gott) (https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/652)
- Implement OfflineVirtualMachines (@pkotas) (https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/667)
